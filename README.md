# React
 Excercises

Here is the code that I am excercising in React, for now all I have is components and states in it. There is documentation mixed in MKD/ENG language.

This is a toy app that is focused around learning the basics of React.js like Components, UseState and we do it through building Expense Tracking System which allows us to track our expenses for each month, year, it also allows us to add new products(date bought, amount paid) into the list so we can have it more organized.
